# iOS SDK Installation

Smartlook SDK is distributted as a binary iOS framework. It is compatible with iOS 10+.

There are several possible ways how to install Smartlook SDK and integrate it to a native iOS (Swift or ObjC) project.

<Alert kind="note" invisibleOn="">
This installation guide refers to the case, when Smartlook is installed in a nativelly created iOS app. If you use some 3rd party framework, like React Native, Cordova, Flutter, Unity etc. to create your app, see the respective SDK installation documentation instead.
</Alert>

## Installing using Cocoapods

Add the Smartlok Pod to your `Podfile`.

<Code
  snippets={{
    ruby: `
pod Smartlook
`,
  }}
/>

More about Cocoapods https://cocoapods.org.

## Manual SDK Installation

1. Download the latest [Smartlook iOS SDK](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-ios-sdk-1.2.5.59.zip) directly.
2. Unzip the file and add Smartlook.framework to your Xcode project.

# Start Recording 

First, add `Smartlook` to your `AppDelegate` among other imports, then *setup* and *start* recording in the application launch method.

**1. Import Smartlook**

<Code
  snippets={{
    swift: `
import Smartlook
      `,
      objc: `
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
      `,
  }}
/>

**2. Setup Smartlook and start recording**

<Alert kind="important">
To setup Smartlook, you need your unique API key. This can be found in your mobile project settings in <a href="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">your Smartlook Dashboard</a>.
</Alert>

<CodeBlock
  snippets={{
      swift: `
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
\n
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
    Smartlook.startRecording()
      `,
      objc: `
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
\n    
    [Smartlook setupWithKey: @"YOUR_API_KEY"];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
      `,
    }
  }
/>

_[Note: the following should be IMHO a in common text included into all SDK installtation docs]_

<Alert kind="note" invisibleOn="">
SDK will upload sessions only on WiFi if you want to upload sessions on mobile connections too, you need to enable this in your project setting in the dashboard. For more details about when your recordings appear in the Dashboard, refer <a href="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this detailed document</a>.
</Alert>

Thats all you need for a quick start.

**After this basic setup SDK will:**
- record your application.
- stop itself automatically on application closure.
<TextBlock invisibleOn="unity,unreal,cocos"><li />automatically hide some default sensitive views.</TextBlock>
- detect basic user gestures and touches.
<TextBlock invisibleOn="ios"><li />records install referrer if present.</TextBlock>
- and much more!
