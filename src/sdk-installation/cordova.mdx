# Installation

1. Add cordova plugin to your project using this command:

<Code
  snippets={{
    cli: `
cordova plugin add https://github.com/smartlook/cordova-smartlook.git
`,
  }}
/>

2. Setup and start Smartlook on [deviceready](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/cordova/events/events.deviceready.html) callback:

<Code
  snippets={{
      javascript: `
if(document.readyState === "complete") {
  document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
}\n
function onDeviceReady() {
    Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording({smartlookAPIKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"});
}
      `,
  }}
/>

To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

3. Smartlook now starts recording the app. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.
