<TextBlock kind='title'>Recording Navigation</TextBlock>

*This section discusses how is the user navigation in the app recorded*

Understanding the way user uses the app is the purpose of the analytics. A typical mobile app breaks into several *screens*, between them users navigates to achieve their goals. 

Smartlook attempts to track the transitions automaticallt and record them as **navigation events**, that are then available in the Dashboard. Another usage of navigation events is generating **heatmpas**.

To generate a meaningfull heatmap, a portion of the app UI with stable structure must be used. Smartlook assumes that a *screen*, i.e., interval between two subsequent navigation events is such a *UI unit*.

<TextBlock kind="important">
Properly dividing the user flow into individual screens important for correct heatmap generation, as each heatmap is generated for a particular screen, i.e., interval between two navigation events.
</TextBlock>

However, the accuracy and usefulness of these auto-tracked navigation events depends heavily on the way the app UI is composed. Smartlook understands well apps that use standard UI kits a paradigms for each platform. If you app is, however, made using a 3rd party frameworks, e.g., a gaming framework, that Smartlook SDK cannot detect the navigation logic of the app. Consult the API reference for the extent auto-detection of navigation events is available on your platform.

In such a case, in orded to get useful navigation data, navigation events must be tracked programatically, using this method:

<TextBlock kind="note">
The navigation event recorded by this method is indistinguishable from the auto-detected navigation events.
</TextBlock>
 
<CodeBlock  kind="example"
    snippets={{
      android: {
      java: `
Smartlook.trackNavigationEvent("LOGIN_SCREEN", ViewState.START);
      `,
      kotlin: `
Smartlook.trackNavigationEvent("LOGIN_SCREEN", ViewState.START)
      `,
    },
    cordova: {
      javascript: `
Smartlook.trackNavigationEvent({name: "LOGIN_SCREEN", viewState: Smartlook.ViewState.START})
      `,
    },
    ionic: {
      typescript: `
smartlook.trackNavigationEvent(new SmartlookNavigationEvent("LOGIN_SCREEN", SmartlookViewState.START));
      `,
    },   
      ios: {
      swift: `
Smartlook.trackNavigationEvent(withControllerId: "LOGIN_SCREEN", type: .enter)
`,
      'objective-c': `
[Smartlook trackNavigationEventWithControllerId:@"LOGIN_SCREEN" type:SLNavigationTypeEnter];`,
    },
  }}
/>

where the type value is either of `enter` or `exit` kind. The `exit` event also records the duration from the previous corresponding enter event.
