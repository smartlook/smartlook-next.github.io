<TextBlock kind='title'>Setup & Start Recording</TextBlock>

*This section deals with how to setup Smartlook SDK and start recording your app.*

To start recording, just put the following code into your application. Once you run your app on a device or in a simulator, recording will appear [in your dashboard](https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects).

In order to function properly, the setup should happen as soon as possible in the app life cycle:

<CodeBlock  kind="example"
  snippets={{
   android: {
      java: `
import android.app.Application;\n
public class MyCustomApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY);
    }
}
      `,
      kotlin: `
import android.app.Application;\n
class MyCustomApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY)
    }
}
      `,
    },
    cordova: {
      javascript: `
if(document.readyState === "complete") {
  document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
}\n
function onDeviceReady() {
    Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording({smartlookAPIKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"});
}
      `,
    },
    ionic: {
      typescript: `
this.platform.ready().then(() => {
    this.smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(new SmartlookSetupConfig("YOUR API KEY"));
}
      `,
    },
    ios: {
      swift: `
include Smartlook
 
...
 
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
 
   Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
   Smartlook.startRecording()
}
      `,
      objc: `
#include Smartlook
 
...
 
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
 
   Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
   Smartlook.startRecording()
}      `,
    },
    react: {
      js: `
// Smartlook initialization
var Smartlook = require("smartlook-react-native-wrapper"); 
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording("API_KEY");
      `,
    },
    xamarin: {
      csharp: `
Xamarin C#
      `,
    },
    unity: {
      csharp: `
Unity C#
      `,
    },
    unreal: {
      csharp: `
Unreal C#
      `,
    },
    cocos: {
      cpp: `
Cocos C++
      `,
      lua: `
Cocos lua
   `
   },
   flutter: {
      dart: `
      Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording('YOUR_API_KEY');
   `,
   }
  }}
/>

This is basically all you need to record your sessions. All other events in the app life cycle are handled by Smartlook automatically.

<TextBlock kind="important">
  It may take several minutes before the recordings appear in the Dashboard. In the default setup, recordings are not uploaded when the device is on a mobile network. In order to see the recordings immediately, make sure the device is on WiFi, or that mobile uploads are enabled in [your project dashboard](https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects). The recording is not streamed, it is uploaded in chunks and then processed on the server. To understand when your recordings will be availabe in the project dashboard, see <Link to="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this document</Link>.
</TextBlock>

<TextBlock kind="note" visibleOn="ios">{`
  When debugging your app with Smartlook, you will encounter a Main Thread Checker warning which might be accompanied by a short app freeze during the app start. The freeze does not happen in production builds. For details, see this <Link to="/cookbooks/ios-main-thread-check-warning">technical note</Link>.
`}</TextBlock>

## Setup Options

Smartlook recording can be customized by several parameters. Some of the recording customization options can be set by dedicated methods, some others can be also set as startup options.
 
<TextBlock kind="important">{`
Not all options are available on all platforms. For a comprehensive list of all the setup options and related details, consult our <Link to="/api_reference/#setup-configuration">API reference</Link>.
